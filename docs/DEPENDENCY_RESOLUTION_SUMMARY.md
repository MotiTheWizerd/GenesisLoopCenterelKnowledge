# Dependency Resolution Summary

## Issue Overview

**Date**: January 30, 2025  
**Duration**: ~2 hours  
**Severity**: Critical - Application startup failure

## Problem Statement

Attempted to add `google-adk` package to enable Google AI capabilities, but encountered cascading dependency conflicts that ultimately led to application startup failure due to a broken `anyio` release.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Version Incompatibility Chain

1. **google-adk 1.8.0** requires `uvicorn >=0.34.0`
2. **Project had pinned** `uvicorn = "0.24.0"` (6 months old)
3. **Updating uvicorn** required `starlette >=0.46.2`
4. **Project had pinned** `starlette = "0.27.0"` (8 months old)
5. **Updating starlette** required `fastapi >=0.115.0`
6. **Project had pinned** `fastapi = "0.104.1"` (4 months old)

### Secondary Issue: Broken Package Release

- **anyio 4.9.0** (latest) contains critical import bugs
- **google-adk** requires `anyio >=4.9.0`
- **No working combination** exists currently

## Resolution Steps Taken

### 1. Core Dependency Updates

```toml
# Updated from pinned versions to compatible ranges
fastapi = "^0.115.0"    # was "0.104.1"
uvicorn = "^0.34.0"     # was "0.24.0"
starlette = "^0.46.2"   # was "0.27.0"
```

### 2. Process Management (Windows)

```bash
# Required to unlock files during updates
taskkill /f /im uvicorn.exe
taskkill /f /im python.exe
```

### 3. Environment Reset

```bash
# Complete clean slate due to package corruption
poetry env remove --all
rm poetry.lock
poetry install
```

### 4. anyio Bug Mitigation

```toml
# Pinned to working version
anyio = "4.6.0"  # 4.9.0 is broken
```

### 5. google-adk Removal

- Temporarily removed due to incompatibility with working anyio version
- Will be re-added when either:
  - anyio > 4.9.0 fixes the import bug
  - google-adk supports older anyio versions

## Final Working Configuration

```toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = ">=3.9,<3.9.7 || >3.9.7,<4.0"
fastapi = "^0.115.0"
uvicorn = "^0.34.0"
starlette = "^0.46.2"
pydantic = "^2.0.0"
requests = "^2.32.4"
rich = "^13.7.0"
typer = "^0.9.0"
beautifulsoup4 = "^4.12.0"
lxml = "^4.9.0"
psutil = "^5.9.0"
anyio = "4.6.0"  # Pinned due to 4.9.0 bug
```

## Key Lessons Learned

### 1. Avoid Aggressive Version Pinning

- **Problem**: Pinned versions prevent security updates and compatibility
- **Solution**: Use semantic version ranges (`^`) for most dependencies
- **Exception**: Pin only for known broken releases (like anyio 4.9.0)

### 2. Update Core Dependencies First

- **Strategy**: Update FastAPI ecosystem (fastapi, uvicorn, starlette) together
- **Reason**: These packages are tightly coupled and must be compatible
- **Process**: Core updates → test → add new packages

### 3. Research Package Issues Before Adding

- **Check**: GitHub issues, release notes, community discussions
- **Verify**: Package compatibility with existing stack
- **Test**: In isolated environment before committing

### 4. Windows Development Considerations

- **Process locks**: Kill processes before major updates
- **Path issues**: Use forward slashes in Python code
- **Permissions**: Run as administrator if needed

### 5. Environment Hygiene

- **Regular resets**: Monthly clean installs prevent corruption
- **Lock file management**: Remove when forcing fresh resolution
- **Testing protocol**: Always test after dependency changes

## Prevention Strategies

### 1. Dependency Management Policy

```toml
# Good: Allows compatible updates
package = "^1.2.0"

# Bad: Locks to old version
package = "1.2.0"

# Acceptable: For broken releases only
package = "1.1.9"  # 1.2.0 is broken
```

### 2. Regular Maintenance Schedule

- **Weekly**: Check for critical security updates
- **Monthly**: Review outdated packages, selective updates
- **Quarterly**: Full dependency audit and documentation update

### 3. Testing Protocol

```bash
# After any dependency change
python main.py          # Test startup
poetry run pytest      # Run test suite
curl /heartbeat        # Test key endpoints
```

### 4. Documentation Requirements

- Document all version pins with reasons
- Maintain troubleshooting guides
- Track known issues and workarounds
- Update team on critical findings

## Monitoring and Future Actions

### Immediate Monitoring

- **anyio releases**: Watch for versions > 4.9.0 that fix import bug
- **google-adk updates**: Check for compatibility with stable anyio
- **Security updates**: Monitor for critical patches in core dependencies

### Future Improvements

1. **Automated dependency checking**: CI/CD pipeline for dependency health
2. **Staging environment**: Test dependency updates before production
3. **Documentation automation**: Auto-update known issues from CI results
4. **Team training**: Share dependency management best practices

## Impact Assessment

### Positive Outcomes

- ✅ **Modernized stack**: Updated to current FastAPI ecosystem
- ✅ **Better security**: Newer versions with security patches
- ✅ **Improved performance**: Newer uvicorn with performance improvements
- ✅ **Enhanced documentation**: Comprehensive troubleshooting guides
- ✅ **Team knowledge**: Shared understanding of dependency management

### Temporary Limitations

- ❌ **google-adk unavailable**: Cannot use Google AI features currently
- ⚠️ **anyio pinned**: Must monitor for updates manually
- ⚠️ **Increased complexity**: More sophisticated dependency management needed

### Risk Mitigation

- 📋 **Documented workarounds**: Clear guidance for similar issues
- 🔄 **Reset procedures**: Reliable recovery from corruption
- 📊 **Monitoring plan**: Proactive tracking of critical packages
- 👥 **Team awareness**: Shared knowledge prevents repeated issues

## Documentation Created

1. **[docs/troubleshooting/dependency-conflicts.md](docs/troubleshooting/dependency-conflicts.md)** - Comprehensive resolution guide
2. **[docs/troubleshooting/known-issues.md](docs/troubleshooting/known-issues.md)** - Current issues and workarounds
