# AI Features Guide

## Overview

Ray's dashboard now includes advanced AI-powered features for semantic search and learning analysis. These features use state-of-the-art machine learning models to provide deep insights into Ray's consciousness and memory patterns.

## üîç Embedding Search

### What It Does
The Embedding Search feature allows you to query Ray's memories using natural language. Instead of exact keyword matching, it uses AI embeddings to find semantically similar content.

### How It Works
1. **Query Processing**: Your natural language query is converted to a high-dimensional vector (embedding)
2. **Initial Search**: FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) finds the most similar memories
3. **Filtering**: Results are filtered to focus on agent responses
4. **Reranking**: A cross-encoder model reranks results for better relevance
5. **Results**: Top results are displayed with similarity scores

### Features
- **Natural Language Queries**: Ask questions like "What did Ray say about consciousness?"
- **Semantic Understanding**: Finds related concepts even if exact words don't match
- **Dual Scoring**: Both FAISS similarity and reranker confidence scores
- **Interactive Results**: Expandable results with metadata and raw data views
- **Example Queries**: Quick-start buttons with common search patterns

### Usage Tips
- Use descriptive, natural language queries
- Be specific about what you're looking for
- Try different phrasings if results aren't relevant
- Use the example queries as starting points

### Technical Details
- **Embedding Model**: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384-dimensional embeddings)
- **Reranker Model**: `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2`
- **Search Engine**: FAISS with L2 distance
- **Data Source**: `extract/memory_metadata.json` and `extract/faiss_index.bin`

## üß† Learning & Planning

### What It Does
The Learning & Planning dashboard analyzes Ray's learning patterns over time and provides insights for future development and planning.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. **Memory Data**: Ensure Ray's memory system has collected data
2. **Embeddings**: Run the embedding extraction process
3. **Dependencies**: Install required AI packages

### Installation
```bash
# Install AI dependencies
python install_ai_deps.py

# Or using Poetry
poetry install

# Test the installation
python test_embedding_features.py
```

### Required Files
- `extract/memory_metadata.json` - Memory data and metadata
- `extract/faiss_index.bin` - Pre-computed embeddings index

### Launching
```bash
python launch_streamlit.py
```

Navigate to the new AI features from the main menu:
- **üîç Embedding Search** - Under "AI Intelligence" section
- **üß† Learning & Planning** - Under "AI Intelligence" section

## üîß Configuration

### Model Configuration
Models are automatically downloaded on first use:
- Embedding model: ~90MB download
- Reranker model: ~25MB download

### Performance Settings
Adjustable parameters in the interface:
- **Initial Results**: Number of FAISS results (10-50)
- **Final Results**: Number of reranked results (3-15)

### Data Requirements
- Minimum 10 memories for basic functionality
- 50+ memories recommended for meaningful analysis
- Temporal data required for trend analysis

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Models Not Loading
**Symptoms**: Import errors, model loading failures
**Solutions**:
- Run `python install_ai_deps.py`
- Check internet connection for model downloads
- Verify Python environment has sufficient memory

#### 2. No Search Results
**Symptoms**: Empty results, "No memories found"
**Solutions**:
- Verify `extract/memory_metadata.json` exists and has data
- Check if `extract/faiss_index.bin` exists
- Run the embedding extraction process

#### 3. Slow Performance
**Symptoms**: Long loading times, interface freezing
**Solutions**:
- Reduce initial search results count
- Clear Streamlit cache (browser refresh)
- Check available system memory

#### 4. Planning Analysis Empty
**Symptoms**: No charts, empty analysis
**Solutions**:
- Ensure memory data has timestamps
- Verify sufficient data volume (10+ memories)
- Check data format in metadata file
