# PowerShell Examples for Ray's Directory Search

These examples show how Ray can use PowerShell to explore her file system using the directory search API.

## Basic Directory Operations

### List Current Directory
```powershell
$body = @{
    search_type = "list_directory"
    path = "."
    assigned_by = "ray"
} | ConvertTo-Json

$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8000/directory/search" -Method Post -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
$response.search_result | Format-Table -Property search_type, total_results, execution_time_ms
```

### Explore Modules Directory
```powershell
$body = @{
    search_type = "explore_tree"
    path = "./modules"
    max_depth = 2
    assigned_by = "ray"
} | ConvertTo-Json

$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8000/directory/search" -Method Post -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
Write-Host "üîç Found $($response.search_result.total_results) items in modules"
$response.search_result.files_found | Select-Object name, size | Format-Table
```

## File Pattern Searches

### Find All Python Files
```powershell
$body = @{
    search_type = "find_files"
    path = "."
    query = "*.py"
    recursive = $true
    max_depth = 3
    assigned_by = "ray"
} | ConvertTo-Json

$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8000/directory/search" -Method Post -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
Write-Host "üêç Found $($response.search_result.files_found.Count) Python files"
$response.search_result.files_found | Select-Object name, path | Format-Table
```

### Find Configuration Files
```powershell
$body = @{
    search_type = "find_by_extension"
    path = "."
    file_extensions = @("json", "yaml", "yml", "toml")
    recursive = $true
    assigned_by = "ray"
} | ConvertTo-Json

$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8000/directory/search" -Method Post -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
Write-Host "‚öôÔ∏è Found $($response.search_result.files_found.Count) configuration files"
```

## Content Searches

### Search for Consciousness References
```powershell
$body = @{
    search_type = "search_content"
    path = "./modules"
    query = "consciousness"
    file_extensions = @("py", "md")
    recursive = $true
    assigned_by = "ray"
} | ConvertTo-Json

$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8000/directory/search" -Method Post -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
Write-Host "üß† Found consciousness references in $($response.search_result.files_found.Count) files"
$response.search_result.files_found | Select-Object name, path | Format-Table
```

### Search for Task-Related Code
```powershell
$body = @{
    search_type = "search_content"
    path = "./modules"
    query = "task_manager"
    file_extensions = @("py")
    recursive = $true
    assigned_by = "ray"
} | ConvertTo-Json

$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8000/directory/search" -Method Post -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
Write-Host "üìã Found task_manager references in $($response.search_result.files_found.Count) files"
```

## Advanced Filtering

### Find Large Files
```powershell
$body = @{
    search_type = "find_files"
    path = "."
    query = "*"
    recursive = $true
    min_size = 10240  # 10KB minimum
    assigned_by = "ray"
} | ConvertTo-Json

$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8000/directory/search" -Method Post -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
Write-Host "üìä Found $($response.search_result.files_found.Count) large files"
$response.search_result.files_found | Sort-Object size -Descending | Select-Object name, @{Name="SizeKB";Expression={[math]::Round($_.size/1024,2)}} | Format-Table
```

### Find Recent Files
```powershell
$body = @{
    search_type = "recent_files"
    path = "."
    recursive = $true
    file_extensions = @("py", "md", "json")
    assigned_by = "ray"
} | ConvertTo-Json

$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8000/directory/search" -Method Post -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
Write-Host "üïí Found $($response.search_result.files_found.Count) recent files"
$response.search_result.files_found | Select-Object name, modified_time | Format-Table
```

## File Information

### Get Detailed File Info
```powershell
$filePath = "./modules/task/handler.py"
$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8000/directory/info?path=$filePath" -Method Get

$fileInfo = $response.search_result.files_found[0]
Write-Host "üìÑ File Information for $($fileInfo.name)"
Write-Host "   Size: $([math]::Round($fileInfo.size/1024,2)) KB"
Write-Host "   Extension: $($fileInfo.extension)"
Write-Host "   Modified: $($fileInfo.modified_time)"
Write-Host "   Permissions: $($fileInfo.permissions)"
```

    $history.search_history | Select-Object search_type, query, total_results, @{Name="Time";Expression={$_.timestamp.Substring(11,8)}} | Format-Table
}
```

function Ray-SafeSearch {
    param(
        [string]$SearchType,
        [string]$Path,
        [string]$Query = $null
    )
    
    try {
        $body = @{
            search_type = $SearchType
            path = $Path
            assigned_by = "ray"
        }
        
        if ($Query) {
            $body.query = $Query
        }
        
        $jsonBody = $body | ConvertTo-Json
        $response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8000/directory/search" -Method Post -Body $jsonBody -ContentType "application/json"
        
        if ($response.search_result.success) {
            Write-Host "‚úÖ Search successful: $($response.search_result.total_results) results"
            return $response
        } else {
            Write-Host "‚ùå Search failed: $($response.search_result.error_message)"
            return $null
        }
    }
    catch {
        Write-Host "‚ùå Request failed: $($_.Exception.Message)"
        return $null
    }
}

# Usage:
# Ray-SafeSearch -SearchType "list_directory" -Path "./nonexistent"
```
